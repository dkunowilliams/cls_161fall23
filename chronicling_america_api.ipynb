These two titles subsequently merged into one publication on September 1, 1943. The resulting Ocala (FL) Star-Banner [LCCN: sn78002071] has remained the daily newspaper in Marion County (FL) since that time. The Ocala Evening Star was also published from 1897 in a weekly edition, the Ocala (FL) Weekly Star [LCCN: sn84027622]. R.N. Dosh, editor of the Ocala Evening Star in the 1920s and 1930s, gave an address to the Ocala Rotary Club, recalling by-gone editors and rival publications, chiefest of whom was Col. Frank E. Harris of the Ocala Banner in the 1890s. He also remembered that the \"Star first saw the light of day in the press room of the Florida Baptist Witness ... the first editor was A.H. Harding ...\" The Florida Baptist Witness (Ocala, FL) LCCN sn95026767], which began publishing in 1884, was the weekly newspaper of the Florida Baptist Convention, an organ of the Southern Baptist Convention. A variant edition of the same title continues (ca. 2008) to publish. Ocala (FL) is the seat of Marion County (FL) government. The Freeze of 1894 dramatically changed the Ocala into which the Ocala Evening Star was born. The Freeze devastated the citrus industry in Marion County. Between 1895 and 1943, other forms of agriculture took the place of citrus while tourism in the area grew. The Silver Springs theme park, known for its crystal clear waters, would do its part like no other attraction in pre-World War II Marion County. The County remained primarily agricultural until after the war, when its character would again change dramatically.--E.

any interference\\nwith his Interest in the said company\\nand from excluding him from partici\\npation in the care and management of\\nthe assets and business\\nThe bill in equity is quite lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

in the\\nUnited States supreme court\\nAfter tho decision was announced\\nformer Governor Bradley and his as\\nsociate counsel announced that they\\nwere unable to stale what would be\\nthe next step of the Republican state\\nofficers of Kentucky They said they\\nhad no doubt either of the ultimate\\npossibility of a hearing of these oases\\n111 the United States court as indicated\\nby Jndg o Taft or of the final result\\nbut at present counsel could not say\\nwhat would be the next procedure\\nThe following is the decision of\\nJudge Taft in part\\nThe injnnotiveprocess ol the court\\nis sought to prevent a removal from\\noffioe It is unnecessary to discuss\\nthe question whether a federal ques\\ntion is presented upon the face of this\\nbill or to consider the correctness of\\nthe claims of complainant that tho\\nrights and immunities secured to him\\nas a citizen of the United States by\\nthe fourteenth amendment to the fed\\neral constitution are infringed or are\\nlikely to be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a remedy at\\nlaw to prevent usurpation in office If\\nin such proceeding any federal ques\\ntion can be raised complainant may\\ncarry it if decided against him by the\\nstate courts by writ of error to the\\nsupreme court of the United States\\nThe judge held that public office in\\nKentucky is not property but a trusts\\nwhere compensations only for servi\\nces rendered It is not even a con\\ntract\\nThe action of Judge TaCt did not\\ndiscourage Governor Taylor in the\\nleast He contends that the matter\\nhas nothagSgbateve to 1 do with his\\nown case and jflien Informed of

congress\\nwas In session and the committee\\ndeemed h wise to make k sullicfently\\nremote to allow ample time for prepa\\nration hence December was selected\\nIt Is both Interesting and appropriate\\n1 at this time to recall something of the\\nhistory of the early days of Wa bing\\nton for while the schoolbooks historic\\nand other witnesses in the Held of lit\\nerature contain full records yet the\\npeople are probably not so familiar\\nwith It as not to read with interest al1\\nthat may be written about it It is\\nt\\nI\\nwell known that the selection of the\\npresent site of the national government\\nwas one of President Washingtons\\ndearest wishes and he It was who se\\ncured the necessary legislative action\\nand bore the brunt of the burden of\\nsetting the stripling capital on its\\nfeet When first Inaugurated Presi\\ndent Washington was busy with his\\nplans for the creation of a great na\\ntional city on the shores of his beloved\\nPotomac He was In this as in many\\nother matters away ahead of his time\\nThe site of the present capital had\\nbeen seen by him and had won his ad\\nmiration many years before When a\\nmere boy while riding over the coun\\ntry on horseback he had noticed tho\\nlocation and its beautiful surroundings\\nand had spoken of its eminent tituess\\nfor the purpose for which It was final\\nly chosen Then there vas nothing\\nhere but wooded slopes partly tilled by\\ntwo or three farmers On the hilltops\\nwas an almost unbroken thicket of\\nscrub oaks and the lowlands were cov\\nered with underbrush of alder but be\\ntween the broad Potomac and the\\nbluffs a mile and a half away and the\\nheights of Hock creek at Georgetown\\nand of the Eastern branch live miles\\napart there lay an amphitheater of\\nsuch gentle slopes and useful levels\\nthat the eye of the young surveyor\\nwas quickly attracted to It The pres\\nIdenta choice was not approved with\\nout a struggle for there was bitter op\\nposition on the part of those who want\\ned other sites selected For eight or\\nten years n bitter contest was waged\\nIn congress over the question and\\nthere were those who characterized the\\nspot advocated by Washington as a\\npestilential swamp There were many\\naspirants and even at that early day\\nsectional jealousies were strong Hut\\nall the world knows the termination of\\nthe contest and It must have been\\nwith genuine pleasure that President\\nWashington came down to Ueorgetown\\nand Issued March oO 1711 his orders\\nto the commissioners who had been\\nchosen to survey the federal city\\nThe plan of the city was drawn by\\nMajor Pierre Charles 1Knfant a\\nFrench engineer who had come to the\\nUnited States from Paris In 1777 and\\nhad served during the Ilevolutlonary\\nwar in the French contingent under the I\\nCount dKstalng He had charge of the\\nreconstruction of the ole city hall In\\nNew York when it was prepared as a\\nfederal house for the lirst congress\\nand had also arranged the building in\\nPhiladelphia which was used for the\\nsame purpose When the details of\\nLEnfantsplancf Washington had been\\narranged he made a finished drawing\\nof it and it was approved by the

held\\nresponsible for It than are other com\\nmonwealths for Illicit distilling smug\\ngling horse stealing or any other\\ncrime which may occur within their\\nBorders At all events the authorities\\nare taking prompt and vigorous steps\\nto crush out the evil and In this they\\nhave the entire sympathy and encour\\nagement of the people of the whole\\nstate except of course those who\\nhave profited by the system and those\\nonly There Is in the matter no poll\\ntics no party or race issue at stake\\nWhile the prejudice against the negro\\nstill exists and will doubtless continue\\nI toexlst for more than one generation\\nto come it has nothing to do with tile\\npresent deplorable conditions condi\\ntions from which it Is expected that the\\ncounty will soon be freed\\nSome years ago there was Inaugu\\nrated here the convict contract labor\\nsystem practically the same as has I\\nexisted in many other states the state I\\nprisoners being farmed out to the\\ncotton planters In the neighborhood\\nthe revenue of their labor being return\\ned While this system has been gen\\nerally condemned by people of liberal\\nviews all over the country when con\\nducted properly It has been entirely\\nwithin the pale of the law and Is no\\nworse as a matter of principle than\\ncontract labor operating within prison\\nwalls though It affords greater oppor\\ntunities for cruelty and injustice on the\\npart of overseers and guards Original\\nly the prisoners upon conviction were\\ntaken to a large central stockade con\\nducted by the state authorities from\\nwhence they were conveyed to the\\nplantations where when not working\\nin the fields they were confined in\\nsmaller stockades Aside from the oc\\ncasional exhibition of brutality this\\nwas entirely In accordance with the\\nlaw Steadily and Insidiously have the\\nevil features of the contract system\\ngrown and upon It have been Ingraft\\ned other and still more serious evils un\\ntil a system of negro slavery exists In\\nIts worst form though comparatively\\nupon a small scale Private stockades\\nIn contradistinction tothe convict stock\\nades where the state prisoners are con\\nfined have been established where\\nthere has been a general trafficking in\\nnegroes who have been sold or leased\\nplanters apparently without let or\\nhindrance Negroes are Induced by va\\nrious means to sign contracts which\\nvirtually make them the slaves of\\ntheir employers being led Into these\\ncontracts by their Ignorance and pov\\nerty The most striking feature of\\nthese contracts Is the circumstance that\\nno time limit Is set to the term of con\\nfinement and no remuneration desig\\nnate When these means fail to sup\\nply the planters the desired number of\\nlaborers negroes are arrested upon\\nwarrants Issued by local magistrates\\nupon trivial and frequently trumped\\nup charges and Instead of being\\ngiven a trial are hustled off to the\\nstockades and put to work at once on\\nthe various plantations Not Infre I\\nquently kidnaping Is resorted to and\\nnegroes are thrown Into the stockades\\nwithout any semblance of legal pro\\ncedure O course In the state stock\\nade the prisoners are convicted by due\\nprocess of law but In the private stock\\nades many men wholly Innocent of\\nWrongdoing have been forced Into the\\nmost cruel and oppressive bondage\\nFlogging Is a very common thing\\nand guns and bloodhounds are freely\\nemployed 1m the purswlt of the hapless i\\ndarky who attempts to escape from\\nbondage It Is slavery more pitiless\\nand cruel than that of the old days\\nbecause It is predicated upon the tacit\\nunderstanding that the bondmen are\\ncriminals and are treated as such It\\nIt the eA

State\\nCaleb Powers charged with con\\nspiracy to murder Senator Goebel\\nand gave some sensational testimo\\nny Goldon wan rather nervous\\nbut did not hesitate in his replies to\\nquestions and hit testimony made a\\ndeep impression\\nAccording to Golden Caleb Powers\\nwas one of the prime movers in the\\nbringing to Frankfort of tho mount\\naineers just before tho assassination\\nof Ooebel and that although Scots\\nlary Powers simply instructed him to\\nbring witnesses who were mountain\\nfeudists yet Golden understood that\\nthey were to como to Frankfort for a\\npossible more sinister purpose that\\nof cleaning out the Democratic ma\\njority in the legislature\\nGolden also brought in the name of\\nGovernor Taylor in an incidental way\\nalso tho names of Oulton John Pow\\nore Captain Davis Charles Finloy\\nJudge Bingham and others tho plan\\nto bring the mountaineers to Frank\\nfort having taken on a wider scope\\nthan wns expected\\nGolden was seized with a slight hem\\norrhage during the morning and ad\\njournment was taken earlier than the\\nusual hour\\nGolden began his testimony by say\\ning that ho bad known Secretary\\nPowers for seventeen or eighteen\\nyearn also knew Culton He was also\\nacquainted with Governor Taylor and\\nCaptain John Powers Ho said ho\\nwas a good friend to all of the defend\\nants He was in Frankfort in January\\nand February and saw Secretary Pow\\ners and John Powers nearly every\\nday He was in Frankfort on January\\nm > and went to Harlem county for\\ntwo or throe dupe from there return\\ning to Frankfort\\nGolden resumed his testimony at tho\\nafternoon session Ho dbe saw\\nJohn Powers and a rod blackruns\\ntoched man talking concerning tho\\nclosing of Secretary Powerss office\\nduring the lattera absence\\nI Lad my back turned said Gold\\nen but whoa I turned I saw Johu\\nPowers give the key to the man\\nJohn Powers said to me\\nGoebel is going to be killed this\\nmorning I said This must not bo\\ndoneDo\\nDo you know a man named Die\\nCoombs asked Attorney Campbell\\nI do Ho is colored and lives in\\nBeattyville He came down with the\\nLoo county contingent\\nDid you have any talk with Caleb\\nor John Powers about Dick Coombs\\nNo but they had two niggers there\\nto kill Gobel John Powers told me\\nso They were Hocker Smith and\\nDick Coombs I saw Coombs at the\\ndrug store near tho depot every morn\\ning for a week or so previous to the\\nshooting Coombs talking to a man\\nnamed Wallace in my presence said\\nDn him I know him as far at I\\ncan see him and I can kill him as fur\\nas I can see him He was talking of\\nGoebel\\nThis conversation was in the ad\\njutant generals office I\\nGolden told a story of the events i I\\nleading up to the murder which if\\nsubstantiated will in the minds of\\ni\\nthose connected with tho preiecntlon\\nat least probably go far toward prov\\ning the contentions of the common I\\nwealth that the murder was the result\\nof a plan in which several prominent I\\nmen were involved I I\\nThe testimony did not show that the\\nalleged plot to kill Goebel was part of\\nthe original plan nor did it contain\\nthe names of those who conceived the\\nidea except so far as Goldens remarks\\nabout John Powers gave the impres\\nsion that the latter was one of the\\nmovers The commonwealth sought\\nto show by Goldens conversation with\\nvarious people that not only John and\\nCaleb Powers but others ai well had\\nfull knowledge of the alleged plan of\\nassassination\\nWhether the defense will seek to\\nI\\nimpeach

is came from\\nthe house without any changes what\\never Tho committee went over tho situa\\ntion iu detail concerning the points\\nat issue There were suggestions as\\nto the necessity of emending the bill\\nso as to suit the demands of the Re\\npublican free trade element but these\\nwere considered as moro than offset by\\nthe sltnation in the house and neces\\nsity of maintaining the party

any interference\\nwith his Interest in the said company\\nand from excluding him from partici\\npation in the care and management of\\nthe assets and business\\nThe bill in equity is quite lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

VUcomfort Taylor\\nIn the Lout\\nIn tho circuit court of the United\\nStates at Cincinnati Wednesday\\nJudge W H Taft denied the motion\\nfor a preliminary injunction in both of\\ntM cases from Kentucky I\\nWhile the court held that no injunc\\ntions would issue under thoso bills\\nyet it hold that after the cases had\\nbeen heard in the state courts they\\ncould get in on error for rovlew in the\\nUnited States supreme court\\nAfter tho decision was announced\\nformer Governor Bradley and his as\\nsociate counsel announced that they\\nwere unable to stale what would be\\nthe next step of the Republican state\\nofficers of Kentucky They said they\\nhad no doubt either of the ultimate\\npossibility of a hearing of these oases\\n111 the United States court as indicated\\nby Jndg o Taft or of the final result\\nbut at present counsel could not say\\nwhat would be the next procedure\\nThe following is the decision of\\nJudge Taft in part\\nThe injnnotiveprocess ol the court\\nis sought to prevent a removal from\\noffioe It is unnecessary to discuss\\nthe question whether a federal ques\\ntion is presented upon the face of this\\nbill or to consider the correctness of\\nthe claims of complainant that tho\\nrights and immunities secured to him\\nas a citizen of the United States by\\nthe fourteenth amendment to the fed\\neral constitution are infringed or are\\nlikely to be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a remedy at\\nlaw to prevent usurpation in office If\\nin such proceeding any federal ques\\ntion can be raised complainant may\\ncarry it if decided against him by the\\nstate courts by writ of error to the\\nsupreme court of the United States\\nThe judge held that public office in\\nKentucky is not property but a trusts\\nwhere compensations only for servi\\nces rendered It is not even a con\\ntract\\nThe action of Judge TaCt did not\\ndiscourage Governor Taylor in the\\nleast He contends that the matter\\nhas nothagSgbateve to 1 do with his\\nown case and jflien Informed of

any interference\\nwith his Interest in the said company\\nand from excluding him from partici\\npation in the care and management of\\nthe assets and business\\nThe bill in equity is quite lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

in the\\nUnited States supreme court\\nAfter tho decision was announced\\nformer Governor Bradley and his as\\nsociate counsel announced that they\\nwere unable to stale what would be\\nthe next step

Taft or of the final result\\nbut at present counsel could not say\\nwhat would be the next procedure\\nThe following is the decision of\\nJudge Taft in part\\nThe injnnotiveprocess ol the court\\nis sought to prevent a removal from\\noffioe It is unnecessary to discuss\\nthe question whether a federal ques\\ntion is presented upon the face of this\\nbill or to consider the correctness of\\nthe

be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a remedy at\\nlaw to prevent usurpation in office If\\nin such proceeding any federal ques\\ntion can be raised complainant may\\ncarry it if decided against him by the\\nstate courts by writ of error to the\\nsupreme court of the United States\\nThe judge held that public office in\\nKentucky is not property but a trusts\\nwhere compensations only for servi\\nces rendered It is not even a

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

any interference\\nwith his Interest in the said company\\nand from excluding him from partici\\npation in the care and management of\\nthe assets and business\\nThe bill in equity is quite lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all kinds of steel plates\\nstructural material iron forgingi > made\\nthe material and built bridges mado\\narmor plates and made material for\\nthe same\\nCarnegie owned over CO per cent of\\neach of the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick refused to sell at that price\\nbut offered to sell and allow three\\nmen to value the interest sold Carne\\ngie refused this and left Frick threat\\nening him for not yielding to his de\\nmand\\nmandFBADTOIKT\\nFBADTOIKT BCHEHX OKABOXD\\nFrick now alleges that after his res\\nignation and at the time of this last\\ninterview Carnegie was fraudulently\\nand secretly without Pricks knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a

5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a

5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie

enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

any interference\\nwith his Interest in the said company\\nand from excluding him from partici\\npation in the care and management of\\nthe assets and business\\nThe bill in equity is quite lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

de\\nmand\\nmandFBADTOIKT\\nFBADTOIKT BCHEHX OKABOXD\\nFrick now alleges that after his res\\nignation and at the time of this last\\ninterview Carnegie was fraudulently\\nand secretly without Pricks knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie

enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a

5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

any interference\\nwith his Interest in the said company\\nand from excluding him from partici\\npation in the care and management of\\nthe assets and business\\nThe bill in equity is quite lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all kinds of steel plates\\nstructural material iron forgingi > made\\nthe material and built bridges mado\\narmor plates and made material for\\nthe same\\nCarnegie owned over CO per cent of\\neach of the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick refused to sell at that price\\nbut offered to sell and allow three\\nmen to value the interest sold Carne\\ngie refused this and left Frick threat\\nening him for not yielding to his de\\nmand\\nmandFBADTOIKT\\nFBADTOIKT BCHEHX OKABOXD\\nFrick now alleges that after his res\\nignation and at the time of this last\\ninterview Carnegie was fraudulently\\nand secretly without Pricks knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a

any interference\\nwith his Interest in the said company\\nand from excluding him from partici\\npation in the care and management of\\nthe assets and business\\nThe bill in equity is quite lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all kinds of steel plates\\nstructural material iron forgingi > made\\nthe material and built bridges mado\\narmor plates and made material for\\nthe same\\nCarnegie owned over CO per cent of\\neach of the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick refused to sell at that price\\nbut offered to sell and allow three\\nmen to value the interest sold Carne\\ngie refused this and left Frick threat\\nening him for not yielding to his de\\nmand\\nmandFBADTOIKT\\nFBADTOIKT BCHEHX OKABOXD\\nFrick now alleges that after his res\\nignation and at the time of this last\\ninterview Carnegie was fraudulently\\nand secretly without Pricks knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal the\\nknowledge thereof from Frick I\\nII\\n7 t <\\nHAS NO JURISDICTION\\nJudge Tafte Decision Turns Tay\\nlor Down\\nSAYS SUPREME COURT IS OPEN\\nOnice a Trust Not 1ropertjr Declilon\\nSide Not VUcomfort Taylor\\nIn the Lout\\nIn tho circuit court of the United\\nStates at Cincinnati Wednesday\\nJudge W H Taft denied the motion\\nfor a preliminary injunction in both of\\ntM cases from Kentucky I\\nWhile the court held that no injunc\\ntions would issue under thoso bills\\nyet it hold that after the cases had\\nbeen heard in the state courts they\\ncould get in on error for rovlew in the\\nUnited States supreme court\\nAfter tho decision was announced\\nformer Governor Bradley and his as\\nsociate counsel announced that they\\nwere unable to stale what would be\\nthe next step of the Republican state\\nofficers of Kentucky They said they\\nhad no doubt either of the ultimate\\npossibility of a hearing of these oases\\n111 the United States court as indicated\\nby Jndg o Taft or of the final result\\nbut at present counsel could not say\\nwhat would be the next procedure\\nThe following is the decision of\\nJudge Taft in part\\nThe injnnotiveprocess ol the court\\nis sought to prevent a removal from\\noffioe It is unnecessary to discuss\\nthe question whether a federal ques\\ntion is presented upon the face of this\\nbill or to consider the correctness of\\nthe claims of complainant that tho\\nrights and immunities secured to him\\nas a citizen of the United States by\\nthe fourteenth amendment to the fed\\neral constitution are infringed or are\\nlikely to be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a remedy at\\nlaw to prevent usurpation in office If\\nin such proceeding any federal ques\\ntion can be raised complainant may\\ncarry it if decided against him by the\\nstate courts by writ of error to the\\nsupreme court of the United States\\nThe judge held that public office in\\nKentucky is not property but a trusts\\nwhere compensations only for servi\\nces rendered It is not even a con\\ntract\\nThe action of Judge TaCt did not\\ndiscourage Governor Taylor in the\\nleast He contends that the matter\\nhas nothagSgbateve to 1 do with his\\nown case and jflien Informed of Judge\\nTatts decision he said\\nI never really believed that the\\nmatter could be made to stick in the\\ncourt before iJudge Taft but we felt\\nobliged to tryif This is a case where\\nall the legal

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie

purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie

any interference\\nwith his Interest in the said company\\nand from excluding him from partici\\npation in the care and management of\\nthe assets and business\\nThe bill in equity is quite lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

de\\nmand\\nmandFBADTOIKT\\nFBADTOIKT BCHEHX OKABOXD\\nFrick now alleges that after his res\\nignation and at the time of this last\\ninterview Carnegie was fraudulently\\nand secretly without Pricks knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie

lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

in the\\nUnited States supreme court\\nAfter tho decision was announced\\nformer Governor Bradley and his as\\nsociate counsel announced that they\\nwere unable to stale what would be\\nthe next step

be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a

to the\\nsupreme court of the United States\\nThe judge held that public office in\\nKentucky is not property but a trusts\\nwhere compensations only for servi\\nces rendered It is not even a

any interference\\nwith his Interest in the said company\\nand from excluding him from partici\\npation in the care and management of\\nthe assets and business\\nThe bill in equity is quite lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

in the\\nUnited States supreme court\\nAfter tho decision was announced\\nformer Governor Bradley and his as\\nsociate counsel announced that they\\nwere unable to stale what would be\\nthe next step of the Republican state\\nofficers of Kentucky They said they\\nhad no doubt either of the ultimate\\npossibility of a hearing of these oases\\n111 the United States court as indicated\\nby Jndg o Taft or of the final result\\nbut at present counsel could not say\\nwhat would be the next procedure\\nThe following is the decision of\\nJudge Taft in part\\nThe injnnotiveprocess ol the court\\nis sought to prevent a removal from\\noffioe It is unnecessary to discuss\\nthe question whether a federal ques\\ntion is presented upon the face of this\\nbill or to consider the correctness of\\nthe claims of complainant that tho\\nrights and immunities secured to him\\nas a citizen of the United States by\\nthe fourteenth amendment to the fed\\neral constitution are infringed or are\\nlikely to be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a remedy at\\nlaw to prevent usurpation in office If\\nin such proceeding any federal ques\\ntion can be raised complainant may\\ncarry it if decided against him by the\\nstate courts by writ of error to the\\nsupreme court of the United States\\nThe judge held that public office in\\nKentucky is not property but a trusts\\nwhere compensations only for servi\\nces rendered It is not even a con\\ntract\\nThe action of Judge TaCt did not\\ndiscourage Governor Taylor in the\\nleast He contends that the matter\\nhas nothagSgbateve to 1 do with his\\nown case and jflien Informed of

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie

any interference\\nwith his Interest in the said company\\nand from excluding him from partici\\npation in the care and management of\\nthe assets and business\\nThe bill in equity is quite lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

any interference\\nwith his Interest in the said company\\nand from excluding him from partici\\npation in the care and management of\\nthe assets and business\\nThe bill in equity is quite lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all kinds of steel plates\\nstructural material iron forgingi > made\\nthe material and built bridges mado\\narmor plates and made material for\\nthe same\\nCarnegie owned over CO per cent of\\neach of the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

de\\nmand\\nmandFBADTOIKT\\nFBADTOIKT BCHEHX OKABOXD\\nFrick now alleges that after his res\\nignation and at the time of this last\\ninterview Carnegie was fraudulently\\nand secretly without Pricks knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

in the\\nUnited States supreme court\\nAfter tho decision was announced\\nformer Governor Bradley and his as\\nsociate counsel announced that they\\nwere unable to stale what would be\\nthe next step

Taft or of the final result\\nbut at present counsel could not say\\nwhat would be the next procedure\\nThe following is the decision of\\nJudge Taft in part\\nThe injnnotiveprocess ol the court\\nis sought to prevent a removal from\\noffioe It is unnecessary to discuss\\nthe question whether a federal ques\\ntion is presented upon the face of this\\nbill or to consider the correctness of\\nthe claims of complainant that tho\\nrights and immunities secured to him\\nas a citizen of the United States by\\nthe fourteenth amendment to the fed\\neral constitution are infringed or are\\nlikely to be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a

purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie

lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office

from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a

any interference\\nwith his Interest in the said company\\nand from excluding him from partici\\npation in the care and management of\\nthe assets and business\\nThe bill in equity is quite lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

in the\\nUnited States supreme court\\nAfter tho decision was announced\\nformer Governor Bradley and his as\\nsociate counsel announced that they\\nwere unable to stale what would be\\nthe next step

Taft or of the final result\\nbut at present counsel could not say\\nwhat would be the next procedure\\nThe following is the decision of\\nJudge Taft in part\\nThe injnnotiveprocess ol the court\\nis sought to prevent a removal from\\noffioe It is unnecessary to discuss\\nthe question whether a federal ques\\ntion is presented upon the face of this\\nbill or to consider the correctness of\\nthe claims of complainant that tho\\nrights and immunities secured to him\\nas a citizen of the United States by\\nthe fourteenth amendment to the fed\\neral constitution are infringed or are\\nlikely to be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a remedy at\\nlaw to prevent usurpation in office If\\nin such proceeding any federal ques\\ntion can be raised complainant may\\ncarry it if decided against him by the\\nstate courts by writ of error to the\\nsupreme court of the United States\\nThe judge held that public office in\\nKentucky is not property but a trusts\\nwhere compensations only for servi\\nces rendered It is not even a

5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie

any interference\\nwith his Interest in the said company\\nand from excluding him from partici\\npation in the care and management of\\nthe assets and business\\nThe bill in equity is quite lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick refused to sell at that price\\nbut offered to sell and allow three\\nmen to value the interest sold Carne\\ngie refused this and left Frick threat\\nening him for not yielding to his

knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

in the\\nUnited States supreme court\\nAfter tho decision was announced\\nformer Governor Bradley and his as\\nsociate counsel announced that they\\nwere unable to stale what would be\\nthe next step

Taft or of the final result\\nbut at present counsel could not say\\nwhat would be the next procedure\\nThe following is the decision of\\nJudge Taft in part\\nThe injnnotiveprocess ol the court\\nis sought to prevent a removal from\\noffioe It is unnecessary to discuss\\nthe question whether a federal ques\\ntion is presented upon the face of this\\nbill or to consider the correctness of\\nthe

be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a

any interference\\nwith his Interest in the said company\\nand from excluding him from partici\\npation in the care and management of\\nthe assets and business\\nThe bill in equity is quite lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

de\\nmand\\nmandFBADTOIKT\\nFBADTOIKT BCHEHX OKABOXD\\nFrick now alleges that after his res\\nignation and at the time of this last\\ninterview Carnegie was fraudulently\\nand secretly without Pricks knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

in the\\nUnited States supreme court\\nAfter tho decision was announced\\nformer Governor Bradley and his as\\nsociate counsel announced that they\\nwere unable to stale what would be\\nthe next step

sought to prevent a removal from\\noffioe It is unnecessary to discuss\\nthe question whether a federal ques\\ntion is presented upon the face of this\\nbill or to consider the correctness of\\nthe

be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a

to the\\nsupreme court of the United States\\nThe judge held that public office in\\nKentucky is not property but a trusts\\nwhere compensations only for servi\\nces rendered It is not even a

5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie

enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

any interference\\nwith his Interest in the said company\\nand from excluding him from partici\\npation in the care and management of\\nthe assets and business\\nThe bill in equity is quite lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all kinds of steel plates\\nstructural material iron forgingi > made\\nthe material and built bridges mado\\narmor plates and made material for\\nthe same\\nCarnegie owned over CO per cent of\\neach of the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick refused to sell at that price\\nbut offered to sell and allow three\\nmen to value the interest sold Carne\\ngie refused this and left Frick threat\\nening him for not yielding to his de\\nmand\\nmandFBADTOIKT\\nFBADTOIKT BCHEHX OKABOXD\\nFrick now alleges that after his res\\nignation and at the time of this last\\ninterview Carnegie was fraudulently\\nand secretly without Pricks knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal the\\nknowledge thereof from Frick I\\nII\\n7 t <\\nHAS NO JURISDICTION\\nJudge Tafte Decision Turns Tay\\nlor Down\\nSAYS SUPREME COURT IS OPEN\\nOnice a Trust Not 1ropertjr Declilon\\nSide Not

in the\\nUnited States supreme court\\nAfter tho decision was announced\\nformer Governor Bradley and his as\\nsociate counsel announced that they\\nwere unable to stale what would be\\nthe next step of the Republican state\\nofficers of Kentucky They said they\\nhad no doubt either of the ultimate\\npossibility of a hearing of these oases\\n111 the United States court as indicated\\nby Jndg o Taft or of the final result\\nbut at present counsel could not say\\nwhat would be the next procedure\\nThe following is the decision of\\nJudge Taft in part\\nThe injnnotiveprocess ol the court\\nis sought to prevent a removal from\\noffioe It is unnecessary to discuss\\nthe question whether a federal ques\\ntion is presented upon the face of this\\nbill or to consider the correctness of\\nthe claims of complainant that tho\\nrights and immunities secured to him\\nas a citizen of the United States by\\nthe fourteenth amendment to the fed\\neral constitution are infringed or are\\nlikely to be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a

5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a

lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

any interference\\nwith his Interest in the said company\\nand from excluding him from partici\\npation in the care and management of\\nthe assets and business\\nThe bill in equity is quite lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all kinds of steel plates\\nstructural material iron forgingi > made\\nthe material and built bridges mado\\narmor plates and made material for\\nthe same\\nCarnegie owned over CO per cent of\\neach of the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick refused to sell at that price\\nbut offered to sell and allow three\\nmen to value the interest sold Carne\\ngie refused this and left Frick threat\\nening him for not yielding to his de\\nmand\\nmandFBADTOIKT\\nFBADTOIKT BCHEHX OKABOXD\\nFrick now alleges that after his res\\nignation and at the time of this last\\ninterview Carnegie was fraudulently\\nand secretly without Pricks knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal the\\nknowledge thereof from Frick I\\nII\\n7 t <\\nHAS NO JURISDICTION\\nJudge Tafte Decision Turns Tay\\nlor Down\\nSAYS SUPREME COURT IS OPEN\\nOnice a Trust Not 1ropertjr Declilon\\nSide Not

in the\\nUnited States supreme court\\nAfter tho decision was announced\\nformer Governor Bradley and his as\\nsociate counsel announced that they\\nwere unable to stale what would be\\nthe next step of the Republican state\\nofficers of Kentucky They said they\\nhad no doubt either of the ultimate\\npossibility of a hearing of these oases\\n111 the United States court as indicated\\nby Jndg o Taft or of the final result\\nbut at present counsel could not say\\nwhat would be the next procedure\\nThe following is the decision of\\nJudge Taft in part\\nThe injnnotiveprocess ol the court\\nis sought to prevent a removal from\\noffioe It is unnecessary to discuss\\nthe question whether a federal ques\\ntion is presented upon the face of this\\nbill or to consider the correctness of\\nthe claims of complainant that tho\\nrights and immunities secured to him\\nas a citizen of the United States by\\nthe fourteenth amendment to the fed\\neral constitution are infringed or are\\nlikely to be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a remedy at\\nlaw to prevent usurpation in office If\\nin such proceeding any federal ques\\ntion can be raised complainant may\\ncarry it if decided against him by the\\nstate courts by writ of error to the\\nsupreme court of the United States\\nThe judge held that public office in\\nKentucky is not property but a trusts\\nwhere compensations only for servi\\nces rendered It is not even a con\\ntract\\nThe action of Judge TaCt did not\\ndiscourage Governor Taylor in the\\nleast He contends that the matter\\nhas nothagSgbateve to 1 do with his\\nown case and jflien Informed of

5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie

enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a

any interference\\nwith his Interest in the said company\\nand from excluding him from partici\\npation in the care and management of\\nthe assets and business\\nThe bill in equity is quite lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

in the\\nUnited States supreme court\\nAfter tho decision was announced\\nformer Governor Bradley and his as\\nsociate counsel announced that they\\nwere unable to stale what would be\\nthe next step of the Republican state\\nofficers of Kentucky They said they\\nhad no doubt either of the ultimate\\npossibility of a hearing of these oases\\n111 the United States court as indicated\\nby Jndg o Taft or of the final result\\nbut at present counsel could not say\\nwhat would be the next procedure\\nThe following is the decision of\\nJudge Taft in part\\nThe injnnotiveprocess ol the court\\nis sought to prevent a removal from\\noffioe It is unnecessary to discuss\\nthe question whether a federal ques\\ntion is presented upon the face of this\\nbill or to consider the correctness of\\nthe claims of complainant that tho\\nrights and immunities secured to him\\nas a citizen of the United States by\\nthe fourteenth amendment to the fed\\neral constitution are infringed or are\\nlikely to be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a remedy at\\nlaw to prevent usurpation in office If\\nin such proceeding any federal ques\\ntion can be raised complainant may\\ncarry it if decided against him by the\\nstate courts by writ of error to the\\nsupreme court of the United States\\nThe judge held that public office in\\nKentucky is not property but a trusts\\nwhere compensations only for servi\\nces rendered It is not even a

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

any interference\\nwith his Interest in the said company\\nand from excluding him from partici\\npation in the care and management of\\nthe assets and business\\nThe bill in equity is quite lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

in the\\nUnited States supreme court\\nAfter tho decision was announced\\nformer Governor Bradley and his as\\nsociate counsel announced that they\\nwere unable to stale what would be\\nthe next step

be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a remedy at\\nlaw to prevent usurpation in office If\\nin such proceeding any federal ques\\ntion can be raised complainant may\\ncarry it if decided against him by the\\nstate courts by writ of error to the\\nsupreme court of the United States\\nThe judge held that public office in\\nKentucky is not property but a trusts\\nwhere compensations only for servi\\nces rendered It is not even a

any interference\\nwith his Interest in the said company\\nand from excluding him from partici\\npation in the care and management of\\nthe assets and business\\nThe bill in equity is quite lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

any interference\\nwith his Interest in the said company\\nand from excluding him from partici\\npation in the care and management of\\nthe assets and business\\nThe bill in equity is quite lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all kinds of steel plates\\nstructural material iron forgingi > made\\nthe material and built bridges mado\\narmor plates and made material for\\nthe same\\nCarnegie owned over CO per cent of\\neach of the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

de\\nmand\\nmandFBADTOIKT\\nFBADTOIKT BCHEHX OKABOXD\\nFrick now alleges that after his res\\nignation and at the time of this last\\ninterview Carnegie was fraudulently\\nand secretly without Pricks knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

in the\\nUnited States supreme court\\nAfter tho decision was announced\\nformer Governor Bradley and his as\\nsociate counsel announced that they\\nwere unable to stale what would be\\nthe next step

Taft or of the final result\\nbut at present counsel could not say\\nwhat would be the next procedure\\nThe following is the decision of\\nJudge Taft in part\\nThe injnnotiveprocess ol the court\\nis sought to prevent a removal from\\noffioe It is unnecessary to discuss\\nthe question whether a federal ques\\ntion is presented upon the face of this\\nbill or to consider the correctness of\\nthe claims of complainant that tho\\nrights and immunities secured to him\\nas a citizen of the United States by\\nthe fourteenth amendment to the fed\\neral constitution are infringed or are\\nlikely to be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a

purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie

lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office

from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a

any interference\\nwith his Interest in the said company\\nand from excluding him from partici\\npation in the care and management of\\nthe assets and business\\nThe bill in equity is quite lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick

per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal

in the\\nUnited States supreme court\\nAfter tho decision was announced\\nformer Governor Bradley and his as\\nsociate counsel announced that they\\nwere unable to stale what would be\\nthe next step

Taft or of the final result\\nbut at present counsel could not say\\nwhat would be the next procedure\\nThe following is the decision of\\nJudge Taft in part\\nThe injnnotiveprocess ol the court\\nis sought to prevent a removal from\\noffioe It is unnecessary to discuss\\nthe question whether a federal ques\\ntion is presented upon the face of this\\nbill or to consider the correctness of\\nthe claims of complainant that tho\\nrights and immunities secured to him\\nas a citizen of the United States by\\nthe fourteenth amendment to the fed\\neral constitution are infringed or are\\nlikely to be infringed by the acts of\\nthe defendants done or to be done\\nlilt is sufficient to hold as I do\\nthat a court of equity cannot by pro\\ncess of injunction prevent tho removal\\nof an officer from his office His rem\\nedy must be at law by quo warranto or\\nother like proceedings\\nIt is conceded that the laws of Ken\\ntuoky afford to the complainant a rem\\nedy by quo warranto also a remedy at\\nlaw to prevent usurpation in office If\\nin such proceeding any federal ques\\ntion can be raised complainant may\\ncarry it if decided against him by the\\nstate courts by writ of error to the\\nsupreme court of the United States\\nThe judge held that public office in\\nKentucky is not property but a trusts\\nwhere compensations only for servi\\nces rendered It is not even a

5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all

retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May

Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any

any interference\\nwith his Interest in the said company\\nand from excluding him from partici\\npation in the care and management of\\nthe assets and business\\nThe bill in equity is quite lengthy\\nand as summarized by Willis Cook\\nEsq counsel for Mr Friok is as fol\\nlows i\\nIn 1892 there were two limited part\\nner hlps\\nj1 Called Carnegie Bros t Co\\nlimited with a capital of 5000000\\nwhich lade steel rails and owned only\\nthe Edgar Thompson steel rail in\\nliraddook township and\\ni 2 Called Carnegie Phipps A Co\\nlimited with a capital of 85000000\\nwhich made all kinds of steel plates\\nstructural material iron forgingi > made\\nthe material and built bridges mado\\narmor plates and made material for\\nthe same\\nCarnegie owned over CO per cent of\\neach of the old firms and he with\\nFrick Phipps and others owning in\\nterests in each formed in 1892 what\\nconstituted a new partnership called\\nthe Carnegie Steel Company Limited\\nIn this Carnegie retained over CO per\\ncent and now has 681 per cent while\\nFriok has 6 per cent\\nBoth old firms were merged into tho\\nnow which had a capital of 825000\\n000 and operated all the old works\\nThis new firm was under tho immedi\\nate care and supervision of Frick as\\nchairman from 1892 to December 6\\n1899 It greatly enlarged the capacity\\nof its different works enlarged their\\noutput and purchased other plants\\nore mines etc\\nTHE S8TIUATE8 DIFFERED\\nIn November 1899 Carnegie esti\\nmated the net profits for 1900 at 940\\n000000 and Frick then estimated them\\nat 42000000\\nCarnegie valued the entire property\\nat over 200000000 and avowed his\\nability in ordinarily prosperous times\\nto tell the property on the London\\nmarket for 100000000 sterling or\\n8 600000000\\nIn May 1899 Carnegie actually re\\nceived in cash and still keeps 1170\\n000 given him asa mere bonus for life\\nninety days option to sell his 6Bi per\\ncept interest in this steel company for\\n157950000 Fricks 0 per cent on\\nthat basis would be worth 16288000\\nFrick now alleges right at the head\\nof this enormously successful business\\nwhereby at least in part he made for\\nCarnegie three enormous profits and\\nvalues that Carnegie suddenly and\\nwith malevolent intent toward him on\\nDecember 4 1899 arbitrarily de\\nmanded of him his resignition as\\nchairman and this without any reason\\nexcept to gratify Carnegies malice\\nFrick in the interest of harmony\\ngave his resignation and subsequently\\non January 1900 after Carnegie\\nbad thus deprived him of his office he\\nCarnegie demanded of Frick that he\\nFriok should sell to the firm his in\\nterest in it ata figure which would\\namount to less than onehalf of what\\nthis interest is fairly worth\\nFrick refused to sell at that price\\nbut offered to sell and allow three\\nmen to value the interest sold Carne\\ngie refused this and left Frick threat\\nening him for not yielding to his

knowl\\nedge or consent attempting to carry\\nout a scheme which if successful\\nwould enable Carnegie as Carnegie\\nhoped to confiscate Pricks interest in\\nthe firm at probably not over 88 per\\ncent of its real value that is say not\\nover 6000000 for what on the basis\\nof Carnegies option was worth 16\\n288000\\nAll this it is alleged Carnegie did\\nsecretly and purposely to conceal
